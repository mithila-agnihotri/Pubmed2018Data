Analysis  of research articles from Jan 2018 to March 2018 as obtained from Pubmed

For this analysis, I obtained the data by querying the PubMed database for research articles published between Jan and March 2018. I downloaded the results in the .xml format. It was a relatively large dataset (size: ~ 4 GB).
